An extension of swift types, provided convenience api extension to use.

##Introduce
This is an very useful swift extensions, with it, we could use less code to finish the same 
thing.

##Warning
In order to solve coflict, every extension api has the same prefix hyb_.
This is shorthand of my Chinese name.So don't worry about it.

It supports cocoapods.just add to podfile as bellow:

```
pod 'SwiftExtensionCodes', '~> 0.0.1'
```

##How to use

  print("hehe")
}

Watching the api, is it convenience? Yes,it's useful.
